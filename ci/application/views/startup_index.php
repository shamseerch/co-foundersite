“It’s necessary for the team to brainstorm together as it
yields better ideas. I believe that working from a co-working
space is not just a fad but necessity of startups. Firstly, a coworking
space gives an office area without making a large
dent in your pocket. Secondly, you are flocked by techies,
startups, and entrepreneurs; and their help is readily
available there. Thirdly is networking with these available
talents."
Research shows that startups who work in a co-working
space are four times more likely to succeed than those who
don’t. Working in these spaces ensures one will always be
surrounded by like-minded, talented individuals and teams
which can really benefit you in the short and long term.
